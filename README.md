## Overview  
This analysis was developed as part of the Data DNA September 2025 Challenge, where I took on the role of a Credit Risk Analyst at Nova Bank, a financial institution offering loans across the USA, UK, and Canada. The goal: help Nova Bank balance fair lending with risk protection by identifying who defaults, why, and how to improve lending decisions


##  Home Page – Portfolio Snapshot

**Purpose** :
To provide a high-level overview of Nova Bank’s loan portfolio performance, including total disbursed amount, defaulted amount, borrower base, and overall default rate.


# Key Insights

• 	Total Disbursed: $277M across 28,638 borrowers
• 	Defaults: $68M, with a 22% overall default rate
• 	Borrower Outcomes: 6,283 defaults vs. 22,455 successful repayments

##Actionable Recommendations
• 	Prioritize segmentation and risk driver analysis to reduce the 22% default rate.
• 	Use borrower outcome trends to inform retention strategies and early intervention programs.


## Borrowers Segmentation Page

#Purpose
To analyze borrower characteristics (employment type, loan purpose, geography) and identify segments with elevated default risk.

## Key Insights
• 	Employment Type: Unemployed borrowers show highest default exposure (28%)
• 	Loan Purpose: Debt consolidation loans carry the highest risk (28%)
• 	Geography: USA accounts for the largest share of defaults ($33M)

##Actionable Recommendations
• 	Tighten underwriting criteria for high-risk loan intents like debt consolidation and medical expenses.
• 	Develop targeted financial literacy and repayment support for unemployed and part-time borrowers.
• 	Localize risk mitigation strategies by country, especially for U.S. borrowers.


## Risk Drivers Page

#Purpose
To uncover the key financial behaviors and conditions driving default risk, such as high DTI, utilization, prior defaults, and long-term loans.

##Key Insights
• 	DTI Impact: Default rate spikes to 41% in the >2.5x DTI band
• 	Risk Combos: “High Utilization + High DTI” leads to 60% default rate
• 	Prior Defaults: Strong predictor of future risk across combinations

##Actionable Recommendations
• 	Flag borrowers with high DTI and utilization for enhanced monitoring or pre-emptive restructuring.
• 	Introduce stricter lending thresholds for long-term loans with high-risk profiles.
• 	Use combo risk drivers to build predictive models and early warning systems.


## Insight Table Page

#Purpose
To provide granular, case-level analysis of borrower profiles, risk scores, and recommended actions for relationship management.

##Key Insights
• 	Risk segmentation ranges from “A – Very Low Risk” to “E – Very High Risk”
• 	Action recommendations vary from “Maintain relationship” to “Review borrower – very high risk”
• 	Common risk drivers include low income, high loan amounts, and high credit utilization

##Actionable Recommendations
• 	Automate borrower review workflows based on risk segment and score thresholds.
• 	Maintain strong engagement with stable borrowers to reinforce repayment behavior.
• 	Use this table to support credit committee decisions and frontline relationship managers.
